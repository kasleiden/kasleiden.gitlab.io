### What is anxiety?

Fear is a normal and useful emotion that warns you about danger. Developing and developing yourself is also part of challenges and sometimes overcoming fears. For some students, however, fears grow into impregnable thresholds and all -more problems.

When someone is regularly very anxious, this fear is out of proportions (and is unreal), and gives considerable limitations that greatly disrupt life, we speak of an anxiety disorder.

Fear complaints are the most common mental problems worldwide and often arise in childhood. These complaints usually do not pass on their own and can lead to loneliness, other psychological disorders, substance abuse, social problems, deteriorated school performance or school dropouts.

Anxiety complaints are often not recognized in time, because they manifest themselves in physical complaints, withdrawn behavior, or in other behavioral problems or school refusal, whereby underlying fears are not always considered. When young people only get help when complaints escalate, a long -term and expensive treatment process is often needed, for which there are also long waiting lists. In the event of early intervention, most of the fear complaints can be remedied with proven effective interventions.

### Where can I find more information?

Many organizations provide information or support for schools regarding student anxiety. We will be adding to the overview below in the near future.

The Knowledge Center KJP offers [information for schools](https://www.kenniscentrum-kjp.nl/scholen/angst/) about fear, what the school can do to signal it, and how to respond.

#### Dutch Center for Youth Health
The NCJ focuses mainly on professionals within youth healthcare and shares [guidelines](https://www.ncj.nl/richtlijnen/alle-richtlijnen/richtlijn/angst) about identification, support and guidance to the right care. For healthcare workers in and around school [this summary](/pdf/samenvattingskaart JGZ-richtlijn angst.pdf) might be a handy overview.
