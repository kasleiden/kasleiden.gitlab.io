### What is anxiety?

Everyone is scared sometimes. An anxious feeling can be very helpful. It's a natural reaction that alerts you to danger. Your body is getting ready to respond so you can run or fight. For example, your heart beats faster and your muscles tense. This is a healthy response. If you're having problems at school, at home, or with your health, you may also often feel anxious about them, but these feelings usually subside when your problems subside.

You can also often be afraid without a clear cause for this. Or if the danger or the problem is actually not that great. For example, you are afraid to go to certain places (a square or public transport), or not to do certain things (give a speech, have your blood drawn). Or you worry a lot about everything, so you often can't sleep well or concentrate.

If you are afraid so often, this bothers you a lot and you don't dare to do 'ordinary' or important things, you may have an anxiety disorder. By avoiding (avoiding) things, the fear does not get less, but often worse. For example, it can become increasingly difficult to go to school, make and keep friends, do fun things or work.

If you notice your anxiety getting worse, don't keep walking around with it. The sooner you tackle them, the easier it will be to get rid of them. Talk about it with friends, your parents, your teacher, the doctor or, for example, a confidant at school.
