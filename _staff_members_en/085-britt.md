My name is Britt Reijnders. I am 23 years old and I am currently doing my master's program in Child and Adolescent Psychology at Leiden University. This year I am writing my thesis and I am doing this at the KibA project. I am especially interested in the clinical aspects of my studies and for that reason I am very excited to gain knowledge and experience about specific phobias at the KibA project!
