My name is Laura Baars, I am 23 years old and a student at Leiden University. After completing my Bachelor of Psychology in 2020, I started the Master of Child and Youth Psychology. This year I am writing my thesis and helping with the KibA project. I look forward to contributing to the research and improving treatment for specific phobias.
