My name is Jasmin Rahemenia. I work as a student assistant at the KibA project. Originally I have a background in law, but I started the research master Developmental Psychology at Leiden University. I combine this master with clinical courses of the master Child and Youth Psychology. Additionally, I am doing a clinical internship at GGZ Delfland.
