My name is Ilse Schot, I am 22 years old and I am doing my master School Psychology. I notice that I feel completely at home here because I like working with children and I can help as many people as possible. I also help with the KibA project where I also write my thesis. In my spare time I play football, which I always enjoy doing and I also enjoy rollerblading! I hope to be able to find a nice internship next year to gain more experience and later also be able to work at a secondary school, for example as a school psychologist.
